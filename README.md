# 3rd-prog-in-data-structures
in this program i wanted to learn about expressions and how to convert them so i build a program to convert 4 cases  
1- to convert from postfix to infix 
2- to convert from prefix to infix 
3- to convert from infix to prefix 
4- to convert from infix to postfix.
infix:
its expression which have operators and operands normally beside each others.
prefix:
its expression where the operators comes first the the operands.
postfix:
its opposite prefix the operands comes first then the operators.
examples: 
(1)infix: a+b     , in prefix: +ab     , in postfix: ab+  . 
(2)infix: (a+b)*c , in prefix: +(ab)*c , in postfix: ab+c*.
(3)infix: (a-b/c)*(a/k-l) , in prefix: *-a/bc/a-kl , in postfix:ab-c/ak/l-*
that's all i hope to find my program usefull good luck.
